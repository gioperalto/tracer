# Project Plan

## Project Tasks

While I plan to use a Kanban board to track most of the technical milestones that will be necessary to complete this project, the high-level tasks are outlined below:

1. Provide list of favorite project topics, get paired with mentor (Sprint 1)
2. With project and mentor defined, create a plan (Sprint 2)
3. Gather requirements from mentor (Sprint 3)
    - What kind of app will I build (web, mobile)?
    - How will I know whether a patient tests positive for C19?
    - Are we retrieving data from a source such as FHIR servers? d. How will we notify users (email, text, push notify)?
    - Are there any prescribed technologies to solve this problem?
4. Decide on technologies and app stack (Sprint 3)
    - Web, mobile, or hybrid
    - Front-end?
    - Back-end?
    - Database?
5. Start building app (Sprint 4)
    - High-level app design
    - UML diagrams if necessary
    - Schema design if necessary
    - Setup tech stack if necessary
6. Front-end if necessary (Sprint 5-6)
    - Design/build front-end
    - All required pages
7. Back-end (Sprint 5-6)
    - API layer
    - Persistence (DB)
    - Running service
8. Milestone 1 (Sprint 7)
    - Review M1 with mentor
    - Make necessary adjustments
9. Milestone 2 (Sprint 8)
    - Review M2 with mentor
    - Make necessary adjustments
10. Milestone 3 (Sprint 9)
    - Review M3 with mentor
    - Refine “finished” product
11. Publish (Sprint 10)
    - Deliver source code, binaries if necessary
